"""Checks on one RunIntent.

Three groups, run in this order:
  consistency   roles, the T4 trigger, lineage references; warnings on monitoring and retention
  coverage      criteria a declared monitor can observe, enforced and declared paths, core coverage
                under safeguards-off, the inter-agent channel, the evaluation window
  completeness  the safeguards checklist, monitor specifications, shared surfaces, reportable kinds,
                retention, required fields, intake time and amendments

They check what a filing commits to, not whether it is true. A false filing that is
specific enough passes; catching it needs reconciliation against retained logs.
Rules cite the evasion that motivated them: [T..] the scripted tabletop, [R1 ..] round 1
of the independent tabletop.
