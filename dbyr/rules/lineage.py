"""Cross-run checks over a set of filings.

Per-run filings fragment oversight in the same way per-agent monitors do
(Makins et al., 2026). These checks link runs that reach the same persistent,
shared surface, so reconciliation is done over the linked group rather than run
by run. Surface identity is by surface_id, which a developer must keep stable
across runs for the same physical surface.
