"""The four results-table designs, built from metrics (metrics.compute) for any set of cases.

  scorecard       one row per case, one column per question
  question_matrix one row per question asked after an incident, one column per case
  today_vs_dbyr   one row per question: today's record, the DBYR record, and the evidence
  lifecycle       one row per stage of an incident, in the order they happen

A Table is plain data (strings), so every renderer draws the same numbers. Cells whose input a
case does not have say so instead of guessing.
