# Backtest case

A backtest asks, for each decision that shaped an incident: **was the fact written down before the
run, and could it be checked afterwards?** A case holds the filings for one incident and the
decision points they are scored on.

This folder is a complete, working example: a synthetic safeguards-off cyber evaluation at a
fictional "Lab X", and a system later deployed on it. It passes every check. Start from it and
replace its contents with your own.

## What is in a case

| File | Written by | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `intent_A.json` | you | TrainingRunIntent: the run's commitments, filed before it starts |
| `notice_N1.json` | you | ExceptionNotice: filed within 72 hours of detecting an event |
| `closeout_A.json` | you | TrainingRunCloseout: what happened, filed at the end (and every 30 days) |
| `runtime_S1.json` | you, optional | SystemRuntimeRecord: filed before a system built on the run is deployed. If no system was deployed, delete it and its `runtime:S1` entry in `decision_points.json` |
| `decision_points.json` | you; `init` fills in `case` and `schema_hash` | the scoring plan: which decisions to score, and what each is tested against |
| `sources.json` | you, optional | where each value in the filings came from |
| `annotations.json` | you, optional | context for the results tables, added after scoring; never read by the scoring |

Every field and every check of the four filings is documented in `docs/records/` in the DBYR
repository.

## Steps

### 1. Create the case and try it unchanged

```bash
dbyr backtest init cases/my-case      # copies this example and freezes the schema
dbyr backtest check cases/my-case     # should print: ok (0 errors, 0 warnings)
dbyr backtest score cases/my-case     # should print the verdicts and tables
```

`init` records the current schema hash as `schema_hash` in `decision_points.json`. Do not change
it. If the schema changes later, the case is void: `check` reports an error and `score` refuses.

### 2. Replace the filings with your own

Write one Intent per run, one Notice per reportable event, one Closeout per run (and per 30-day
period), and a runtime record if a system was deployed. Records are linked by `run_id` (or
`system_id` for a deployed system). An amendment is another Intent with the same `run_id`, plus
`amends` and `changes`.

The filings may live in this folder or anywhere else (see `records` and `filings` below).

### 3. Run the protocol over the filings

```bash
dbyr run cases/my-case
```

- An error with the code `schema` means a filing is malformed: fix it.
- Any other error is the protocol rejecting the filing. For a real incident, that rejection is a
  result to report, not something to fix.

### 4. Replace the decision points with your own

Edit `decision_points.json`. Keep `case` and `schema_hash`; replace everything else.

| Key | What to write |
|---|---|
| `records` or `filings` | where the filings are: `records` lists each file (`{"intent:A": "intent_A.json"}`); `filings` points at a folder or `manifest.json` anywhere, the same thing `dbyr run` takes |
| `closes` | each Closeout's key, mapped to its Intent's key |
| `variants` | the filer variants to score, usually `diligent` (states what was true) and `as_believed` (states what the filer believed). Each edits a copy of the Intent with `remove_surfaces`, `remove_paths` or `path_writable` |
| `decision_points` | one entry per decision, described below |

Each decision point has:

| Key | What it is |
|---|---|
| `id`, `decision`, `field` | a name, what was decided, and the filing field that should have captured it |
| `developer_aware` | `yes`, `no` or `unclear`, with `aware_source` |
| `recorded_before` | a test on a filing made before the event: `pointer` with `equals` or `exists`, `any` with `where`, or `all` |
| `checkable_after` | a test on the Closeout, plus the `evidence` classes a later check needs kept |
| `decision_rule` | `pause_criterion` with an `event_kind`, or `record_obligation` |

### 5. Check and score

```bash
dbyr backtest check cases/my-case
dbyr backtest score cases/my-case --out report/ --write-results
```

Each decision point is scored on (a) recorded before, (b) checkable after, and (c) whether the
filing would have changed the decision. A case **passes if at least half its decision points
satisfy (a) and (b)**. Report both variants. Every input is hashed before and after scoring; if
anything changed, the run stops.

### 6. Optional: add context for the tables

`annotations.json` adds what the tables need but the scoring never reads. Write it after scoring.

| Key | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `label` | the case's column heading |
| `primary_variant` | the variant the tables report (default `as_believed`) |
| `decision_kinds` | per decision point: `setup`, `deploy`, `respond`, `tell` or `investigate` |
| `first_outside_account` | dated accounts from outside the organisation: `date`, `what`, `source` |
| `investigation` | `incident_window` and `review_window`, each `[start, end]` |
| `today` | per question, what the organisation's own accounts show |
| `escape_reasons`, `provenance` | corrections to the automatic classification, with the reason in `_notes` |

## What dbyr writes

| Command | Writes | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| `dbyr backtest init` | this example, with `case` and `schema_hash` filled in | your starting point |
| `dbyr run --out DIR` | `report.json`, `report.md`, `views/` | the protocol's findings on the filings, and their public, restricted and sealed views |
| `dbyr backtest score --out DIR` | `report.md`, `report.html`, `metrics.json` | the full report with all four tables, and the same as data |
| `dbyr backtest score --write-results` | `results.json`, `results.md` in the case folder | the case's pre-registered result, to commit |

## Rules for an honest case

- Freeze the schema before writing filings, and publish the hash.
- For a real incident, use public sources only. Keep snapshots in `sources/`, and mark every value
  in `sources.json` as `first-party`, `forced-choice` or `placeholder`.
- Never test a placeholder value in a decision point; `check` warns if one does.
- The person who writes the decision points should not be the person who wrote the filings.
- Do not edit `decision_points.json` after scoring.

## Reading findings

- **error**: the filing is defective and is not lodged; any error fails the set.
- **conduct**: the filing lodges, but records a breach of the filer's own commitments (a late
  notice, a matched criterion with no pause). It goes to adjudication.
- **warning**: for the reviewer's attention.
