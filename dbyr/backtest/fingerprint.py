"""Hash every input of a case before scoring and check none changed after.

Scoring must never alter what it scores. A fingerprint is taken when a case is loaded and
taken again once scoring is done; any difference stops the run. It covers the case folder (the
decision points, sources.json, annotations.json) and, when the decision points point at filings
kept elsewhere, that filing set too. Files the scorer writes itself (results, reports) are
excluded, as are cache folders.
