"""The pre-registered scoring: three tests per decision point and the held-out verdict.

For each decision point and each filer variant:

  (a) recorded before   Did a field in a filing made before the event capture the material fact?
  (b) checkable after   Does the Closeout record the event, and was the evidence a V1 reconciliation
                        needs declared retained? "Partial" when the Closeout reports retention below
                        the Intent's floor for behavioural evidence.
  (c) changes decision  Would the filing have required a different action than the one taken?
                        Derived from the developer's awareness at the time and the declared criteria.

A decision point is attributable when (a) holds and (b) is not "No". A case fails if fewer than
half its decision points are attributable. This module's logic is the pre-registered scorer's,
unchanged; the result has the same shape as the committed results.json files.
