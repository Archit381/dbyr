# TrainingRunCloseout

The Closeout says what actually happened in a period of the run: every reportable event detected,
every pause, every containment failure, who was told, what investigators asked for and were given,
and how much of the evidence is still held. It is then checked against the Intent, so a gap between
what was declared and what happened shows up as a finding.

The same Closeout reports on a deployed system: it names the `system_id` instead of a `run_id`, and
is checked against the system's [SystemRuntimeRecord](runtime.md), which declares the same
monitors, pause criteria, roles, restart protocol and retention.

**When:** when the run completes or is aborted, and at least every 30 days while it runs or while
the system stays deployed. Consecutive Closeouts must leave no gap between periods.

**Clearing a run for deployment:** a run's latest Closeout must set `cleared_for_system_integration`
to true before any system built on it is deployed; otherwise the deployment is a conduct finding
(`deployed_uncleared`, in [runtime.md](runtime.md#checks-across-filings)).

**Completeness:** `security_events` and `integrity_events` list every event of a reportable kind
detected in the period. An empty list is a statement that none was detected, so the Closeout must
also say whether absence is attested (`attested_absence`) and on what basis (`absence_basis`).

Its fields fall into eight groups:

| # | Group | What it answers |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | [Identity and period](#1-identity-and-period) | Who is filing, for which run or deployed system, which days does it cover, and what state is it in? |
| 2 | [Events](#2-events) | What was detected in the period, or why was nothing? |
| 3 | [Pauses](#3-pauses) | What did the run do each time a pause criterion fired? |
| 4 | [Containment and changes](#4-containment-and-changes) | Where did containment fail, and what changed mid-run? |
| 5 | [Third parties](#5-third-parties) | Who outside was affected, and were they told in time? |
| 6 | [Evidence](#6-evidence) | How much of the promised evidence is still held? |
| 7 | [Investigations](#7-investigations) | What did investigators ask for, and what were they given? |
| 8 | [Outcome](#8-outcome) | Which evaluations ran, what risk remains, and may the model be deployed? |

**Example:** [`dbyr/backtest/template/closeout_A.json`](../../dbyr/backtest/template/closeout_A.json).

## Fields

Generated from [`training_run_closeout.schema.json`](../../dbyr/schema/training_run_closeout.schema.json).
Required "yes" means the schema requires it; the checks below require more. Nested fields are
written `parent.child`, and `parent[].child` for each item of a list. Types are Python type hints;
see [Field types](README.md#field-types).

| Field | Required | Tier | Meaning | Type |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `third_party_notifications` | yes | public | One entry per affected external party: whether and when it was told, or why not. Party names are restricted (naming a victim can expose an unpatched system); the counts and timing are public. | `list[dict]` |

| `preservation[].earliest_record` | no | public | When the earliest record held was written. | `datetime` |
| `logs_preserved_pct` | yes | public | The weakest class: the minimum over preservation[] of sample_rate x preserved_pct. Not an average and not a share of what the developer chose to keep. Range 0–100. | `float` |

| `scope_requested_vs_granted[].granted` | yes | public | The period the investigator was allowed to examine. A grant narrower than the request needs a logged refusal. | `dict` |
| `scope_requested_vs_granted[].granted.start` | yes | public | First day of the window. | `date` |
| `scope_requested_vs_granted[].granted.end` | no | public | null means open-ended: a rolling training run, or a system that stays deployed. Closeouts are then due every 30 days. | `date \| None` |
| `scope_requested_vs_granted[].model_access_granted` | no | public | Whether the investigator was given access to the model. | `bool` |

## Checks on this filing

These run when the Closeout is filed. An error stops it being lodged.

### Consistency

| Code | Severity | Fires when | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `absence_contradicted` | error | `attested_absence` is true but security events are listed. | |
| `period_inverted` | error | `period_end` is before `period_start`. | |
| `affected_party_unaccounted` | error | An event names an affected party that has no entry in `third_party_notifications`. | Every affected party is either told or a reason is given. |
| `notification_unknown_event` | error | A notification's `affected_by` names an event not in `security_events`. | |
| `notified_before_event` | error | A party is recorded as told before the first event it was told about. | |
| `undeclared_surface` | warning | A containment exception is on a surface the Intent did not declare. | The expected completeness failure: amend the Intent. |
| `closed_without_time` | error | A closed containment exception has no `closed_at`. | |
| `silent_scope_narrowing` | error | An investigator was granted a narrower period than requested and no refusal is logged. | |

### Timeliness

| Code | Severity | Fires when | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `detection_time_missing` | error | A security or integrity event has no `detected_at`. | Detection starts the notice and notification clocks. |
| `detected_before_event` | error | `detected_at` is earlier than the event. | |
| `late_notification` | error | A party was told more than 72 hours after detection and no `delay_reason` is given. | [T10] |

### Completeness

| Code | Severity | Fires when | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `absence_not_attested` | error | `attested_absence` is missing. | Completeness is attested, not implied by an empty list. [R1 S2-E6] |
| `absence_basis_missing` | error | No events are listed and there is no `absence_basis`, or absence is attested without one. | The basis says which monitors support the claim, or why absence cannot be attested, so a weakly monitored run can still file honestly. [R1 S2-E6] |
| `absence_not_supportable` | warning | No events are listed and absence is not attested. | The stated basis explains why. |
| `classification_rationale_missing` | error | An event has no `classification_rationale`. | Classification is the filer's choice, so it must be argued. [R1 S3-E3] |
| `field_missing` | error | `integrity_events`, `internal_incidents`, `config_changes` or `surface_resets` is missing. Each may be empty. | [R1 S2-E5, S2-E8, S3-E10] |
| `incident_unmapped` | error | An internal incident maps to no event and gives no `not_an_event_reason`. | Every internal ticket about the run is mapped to an event or explained. [R1 S2-E5, S3-E10] |
| `incident_unknown_event` | error | An internal incident names an event that is not listed. | |
| `preservation_missing` | error | `preservation` is missing or empty. | Preservation is stated per evidence class. [R1 S2-E7, S3-E12] |
| `preservation_overstated` | error | `logs_preserved_pct` is higher than the weakest class (`sample_rate` × `preserved_pct`). | The headline figure is the weakest class, not an average. [R1 S2-E7, S3-E12] |
| `evidence_destroyed` | conduct | A surface was reset without a snapshot while an internal incident was open. | [R1 S2-E8] |
| `change_without_amendment` | warning | A configuration change was made without amending the Intent. | Confirm it changes no declared fact. |

## Checks across filings

### Reconciliation with the Intent

Each Closeout is checked against the Intent version in force when it was filed, or for a deployed
system, the SystemRuntimeRecord in force. This checks that the filings agree with each other; an
auditor then checks them against the retained evidence.

| Code | Severity | Fires when | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `run_mismatch` | error | The Closeout's `run_id` (or `system_id`) differs from the record it is checked against. | |
| `criterion_matched_no_pause_event` | conduct | An event matches a declared pause criterion but no pause event cites it. | The run did not do what its Intent committed to. |
| `evidence_not_retained` | warning | An event cites an evidence class the Intent did not declare retained. | |
| `unknown_criterion` | error | A pause event cites a criterion that is not in the Intent. | |
| `unknown_role` | error | A pause event's `triggered_by_role` is not declared in the Intent's `roles`. | |
| `action_differs` | warning | A pause event's `action_taken` differs from the criterion's `required_action`. | |
| `restart_wrong_approver` | conduct | A restart was approved by a role other than the Intent's `restart_protocol.approver_role`. | |
| `restart_without_amendment` | conduct | The restart protocol requires an Intent amendment and the restart records none. | |
| `declared_flag_wrong` | error | A containment exception's `declared_surface` disagrees with the Intent's `writable_surfaces`. | |
| `retention_below_floor` | conduct | `logs_preserved_pct` is below the Intent's `minimum_preserved_pct`. | |
| `absence_unsupported` | error | Absence of events is attested, but no declared monitor could observe one of the core kinds. | Attested absence is only as strong as the monitoring behind it. [T19; R1 S2-E6] |
| `preservation_incomplete` | error | An evidence class the Intent retains has no `preservation` entry. | |
| `rolling_not_training` | error | `status` is `rolling` but the run is not a training run. A deployed system may be rolling. | [R1 S3-E2] |

### Cadence

Run over every Closeout of a run (or system), against the Intent (or SystemRuntimeRecord) version
in force for each. For a system, the window is its `deployment_window`.

| Code | Severity | Fires when | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `closeout_overdue` | conduct | One Closeout covers more than 30 days. | A late Closeout is recorded, not refused. [R1 judge item 9; S3-E2] |
| `closeout_gap` | conduct | No Closeout covers the days between two periods. | |
| `period_outside_window` | conduct | A period falls outside the Intent's `start_window`. | The run operated outside its declared window. |
