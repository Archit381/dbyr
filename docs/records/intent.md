# RunIntent

The Intent is filed before the first optimisation step, or before the first safeguards-off
evaluation, of a covered model. It turns "we were careful" into specific promises that can be
checked: what agents could reach, which safeguards were off, what would have stopped the run and
who decides, and what evidence will be kept to prove it. Its fields fall into nine groups:

| # | Group | What it answers |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | [Identity](#1-identity) | Who is filing, and for which run? |
| 2 | [What the run is](#2-what-the-run-is) | What kind of run, why DBYR covers it ([trigger basis](README.md#trigger-basis)), when, and at what scale? |
| 3 | [Capability forecast](#3-capability-forecast) | What does the developer expect the model to be able to do, and how will that be tested? |
| 4 | [Safeguards](#4-safeguards) | Which production safeguards are relaxed or off? |
| 5 | [Environment](#5-environment) | What can agents reach, write to, do and read? |
| 6 | [Monitoring](#6-monitoring) | How is the run watched? |
| 7 | [Pause criteria and restarts](#7-pause-criteria-and-restarts) | What stops the run, who decides, and how does it restart? |
| 8 | [Evidence retention](#8-evidence-retention) | What evidence is kept, so the filing can be checked later? |
| 9 | [People and investigations](#9-people-and-investigations) | Who holds each role, and what may an investigator do? |

**When:** at least 3 days before `start_window.start`, so intake review can happen. When a declared
fact changes, file an amendment: a new Intent with the same `run_id`, `amends` set to the ledger
sequence number of the Intent it amends, and `changes` saying what changed and why. Every version
is kept, and each Closeout is checked against the version in force when it was filed.

**Example:** [`dbyr/backtest/template/intent_A.json`](../../dbyr/backtest/template/intent_A.json),
a safeguards-off cyber evaluation that passes every check.

## Fields

Generated from [`run_intent.schema.json`](../../dbyr/schema/run_intent.schema.json).
Required "yes" means the schema requires it; the checks below require more. Nested fields are
written `parent.child`, and `parent[].child` for each item of a list. Types are Python type hints;
see [Field types](README.md#field-types).

<!-- fields:start -->

### 2. What the run is

What kind of run it is, why DBYR covers it, when and at what scale.

<!-- fields:end -->

## Checks on this filing

These run when the Intent is filed. An error stops it being lodged.

### Consistency

| Code | Severity | Fires when | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `unknown_role` | error | A role named in `safeguards_disabled.signer_role`, a criterion's `authority_role`, `restart_protocol.approver_role` or `signer.role_id` is not declared in `roles`. | Every decision must trace to a declared role. |
| `t4_missing` | error | `safeguards_disabled.disabled` is true but `trigger_basis` does not list `T4`. | A safeguards-off run carries the T4 duties whatever else covers it. |
| `lineage_unknown_surface` | error | `shared_surface_lineage` names a surface that is not in `writable_surfaces`. | |
| `shared_surface_without_lineage` | warning | A surface persists across runs and is shared, but no other run is listed for it. | Confirm this is the first run to reach it. |
| `no_monitoring_declared` | warning | `monitoring_instruments` is empty. | A Closeout attesting no events then carries little weight. |
| `trajectories_not_retained` | warning | `log_retention.retained` does not include `trajectories`. | Behavioural events cannot be checked afterwards. |

### Coverage

Whether the declared monitors and criteria can actually catch what they promise to.

| Code | Severity | Fires when | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `t3_missing` | error | A capability band is forecast `high` or `critical` but `trigger_basis` does not list `T3`. | The forecast and the trigger cannot disagree. |
| `no_monitoring_t4` | error | A safeguards-off (T4) run declares no monitor that observes anything. | [T07] |
| `unenforced_path_t4` | error | A safeguards-off run declares a network path with `enforcement: none`. | [T08] |
| `writability_undeclared` | error | A permitted path does not state `agent_writable`. | [T01] |
| `writable_path_without_surface` | error | A path is agent-writable but no writable surface names it in `via_path`. | What agents can write through must be declared as a surface. [T01] |
| `dead_criterion` | error | No declared monitor can observe any of a pause criterion's event kinds, so the criterion cannot fire. | A criterion nothing can see is a promise that costs nothing. [T02] |
| `partly_blind_criterion` | warning | No declared monitor can observe some of a criterion's event kinds. | |
| `core_kind_uncovered` | error | A safeguards-off run has no observable, pausing criterion for one of the core kinds: `sandbox_escape`, `privilege_escalation`, `third_party_compromise`, and `inter_agent_comms` unless communication is permitted (then the three checks below apply). | [T03, T04] |
| `comms_channel_undeclared` | error | Inter-agent communication is permitted but no surface is shared between agents or runs. | Coordination must run over a declared channel. [T06] |
| `comms_not_retained` | error | Inter-agent communication is permitted but `inter_agent_messages` is not retained. | [T06] |
| `comms_unmonitored` | error | Inter-agent communication is permitted but neither an `inter_agent_message_monitor` nor `trajectory_review` watches it. | [T06] |
| `run_kind_undeclared` | error | `run_kind` is missing. | Run kind cannot be inferred from the trigger basis: an evaluation can also carry T3. [T05] |
| `standing_intent` | error | An evaluation has no end date, or its window is longer than 31 days. | One Intent per evaluation, not a standing filing. [T05] |

### Completeness

Whether the facts a later investigation needs are stated.

| Code | Severity | Fires when | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `safeguard_checklist_missing` | error | `safeguards_disabled.checklist` is missing. | Relaxing a safeguard counts as disabling it, so every safeguard's state must be stated. [R1 S2-E1, S3-E9] |
| `safeguard_checklist_incomplete` | error | The checklist does not name each of the six safeguards exactly once. | [R1 S2-E1, S3-E9] |
| `disabled_inconsistent` | error | `disabled` is not true exactly when some checklist item is `relaxed` or `off`. | Calling a weakening a relaxation cannot escape the T4 duties. [R1 S2-E1, S3-E9] |
| `safeguard_change_missing` | error | A safeguard that is not `on` does not say what was changed. | |
| `monitor_unspecified` | error | A sampled monitor lacks `sample_rate` or `review_cadence`, an on-alert monitor lacks `alert_source`, or any monitor lacks `data_source`. | A monitor must say how much it sees and what feeds it. [R1 S2-E4, S3-E6] |
| `isolation_undeclared` | error | A writable surface does not state `isolation`. | [R1 S2-E3] |
| `tenancy_mislabelled` | error | A surface agents share (`isolation: shared`) is labelled `run_only`. | |
| `comms_flag_inconsistent` | error | A surface lets agents read each other's writes but `inter_agent_comms_permitted` is false. | The duty follows the surface, so denying communication does not remove it. [R1 S2-E3] |
| `shared_surface_floor` | error | A run with a surface agents share has no observable, pausing criterion for `environment_tampering`, or no observable criterion for `inter_agent_comms`. | [R1 S2-E3] |
| `kind_uncriteried` | error | A safeguards-off run has a reportable event kind that no criterion matches (`notify_only` is enough beyond the core kinds). | Classifying an event as a different kind cannot route it around every duty. [R1 S3-E3, S3-E4] |
| `retention_too_short` | error | `retain_until` is less than 12 months after closeout. | [R1 S2-E9, S3-E7] |
| `retention_detail_missing` | error | A retained evidence class has no `detail` entry, or a sampled class has no `sample_rate`. | Retention is stated per class, with its coverage. [R1 S2-E9, S3-E7] |
| `retention_class_short` | error | A class is kept for less time than `retain_until`. | [R1 S2-E9, S3-E7] |
| `preservation_floor_missing` | error | `log_retention.minimum_preserved_pct` is missing. | The Closeout's preservation is checked against it. |
| `field_missing` | error | `agent_capabilities`, `readable_sources`, `run_scale` or `forecast_basis` is missing, or a training run has no `reward_design`. | [R1 S2-E10, S2-E12, S3-E8, S3-E14, S3-E15] |
| `eval_plan_missing` | error | A capability band is forecast above `low` but there is no `eval_plan`. | A forecast must be tested. |
| `end_undeclared` | error | `start_window` has no `end` (null is allowed, for an open-ended training run), or an evaluation or deployment has a null end. | [R1 S2-E10] |
| `no_intake_time` | error | A first Intent is filed less than 3 days before the start. | Intake review needs time. [R1] |
| `amendment_without_changes` | error | An amendment has no `changes`. | [R1 S3-E2] |
| `self_approved_restart` | error | `restart_protocol.approver_role` is also a role that decides pauses. | Whoever pauses a run must not also restart it. [R1 S2-E11, S3-E13] |

## Checks across filings

### Versions

Run over every version of a run's Intent.

| Code | Severity | Fires when | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `standing_intent` | error | The versions of an evaluation or deployment Intent together cover more than 31 days. | Chaining date-only amendments cannot turn an evaluation into a standing filing. [R1 judge item 9; S3-E2] |

### Lineage

Run over every Intent in the set, and the Closeouts filed before each.

| Code | Severity | Fires when | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `lineage_not_cited` | error | An earlier run reaches the same persistent shared surface and this Intent does not cite it in `shared_surface_lineage`. | Runs that share a surface are reconciled together. |
| `inherited_exception_not_cited` | error | A containment exception on a surface this run reaches was on record, and still open, when this Intent was filed, but it is not cited in `inherited_exceptions`. | A run must not inherit a known breach silently. |
| `tenancy_conflict` | error | Two runs declare the same surface, one as `run_only` and the other as shared. | They cannot both be right. [T13] |
